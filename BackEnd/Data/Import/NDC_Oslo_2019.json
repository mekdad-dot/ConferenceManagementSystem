In this talk, I will show an alternative approach on how to get started with Machine Learning by using a LEGO car as a model. By using Machine Learning, we can make the LEGO car steer autonomously!\r\n\r\nIn the process of making a LEGO car steer autonomously I will go through the following topics:\r\n- What is Machine Learning?\r\n- Can we make the LEGO car steer autonomously without Machine Learning?\r\n- How does the basic theory behind Machine Learning work?\r\n- How do we connect theory to LEGO bricks?\r\n\r\nThe aim of this talk is not to make you an expert in Machine Learning, however, it will hopefully inspire you to investigate and get familiar with Machine Learning in a playful and simple way.",

            "description": "Automatic text summarization is the process of shortening a text document by automatically creating a short, accurate, and fluent summary with the main points of the original document using software. It is a common problem in machine learning and natural language processing.  \r\n\r\nSince humans have the capacity to understand the meaning of a text document and extract the most important information from the original source using their own words, we are generally quite good at making summaries of a text. However, manual creation of summaries is very time consuming, and therefore a need for automatic summary has arisen. Not only are the automatic summarization tools much faster, they are also less biased than humans. \r\n\r\nNowadays, there are several methods of text summary, but there are two basic approaches to text summary that are based on the output type: extractive and abstractive. In an extractive summary, the most important sentences are extracted and joined to get a brief summary. The abstract text summary algorithms create new sentences and sentences that provide the most useful information from the original text - just as humans do. \r\n\r\nThis lecture provides insight into most common algorithms and tools used for automatic text summarization today, together with the methods used to evaluate automated summaries. \r\n",

            "description": "Why would you ever want to introduce unmanaged code into your managed codebase when recent versions of C# have made writing high performance code in .NET more accessible than ever before? While C# has been pushing downwards into the realm of \"systems programming\", Rust, a language that already operates in this space, has been pushing upwards. The result isn't a competition where one language must emerge as more universally applicable than the other. It's a broader set of cases where C# and Rust can work together, and integrating them effectively is more idiomatic thanks to this broadening of scope.\r\n\r\nWhen we set out in 2018 to rebuild the storage engine for our log server, Seq, we decided to complement our existing C# codebase with a new one written in Rust. In this talk we'll look at why you might want to add unmanaged code to your managed codebase, using Seq as an example. We'll explore how to use the tools that .NET and Rust give us to design and build a safe and robust foreign function interface. In the end we'll have a new perspective on the implicit safety contracts we're expected to uphold in our purely managed codebases.",

We need to use JavaScript more responsibly, which means we must rely on native browser features where prudent, use HTML and CSS when appropriate, and know when too much JavaScript is just that: Too much. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore what happens to performance and accessibility when devices are inundated with more JavaScript than they can handle. We'll also dive into some novel techniques you can use to tailor delivery of scripts with respect to a person's device capabilities and network connection quality. When you walk out of this session, you'll be equipped with new knowledge to make your sites as fast as they are beautiful.",

            "description": "We’ve all heard a lot in the last year about a new advancement in the world of CSS, called CSS Grid. Starting off at whispers, we’re now starting to hear it as a deafening roar as more and more developers write about it, talk about it, share it and start using it. In the world of front end, I see it everywhere I turn and am excited as I start to use it in my own projects.\r\n\r\nBut what does this new CSS specification mean for software developers, and why should you care about it? In the world of tech today, we can do so many amazing things and use whatever language we choose across a wide range of devices and platforms. Whether it’s the advent of React and React Native, or frameworks like Electron, it’s easier than ever to build one app that works on multiple platforms with the language we know and work with best. The ability to do this also expands to styling apps on any platform using CSS, and therefore being able to utilise the magical thing that is\r\nCSS Grid.\r\n\r\nThe reason CSS Grid is gaining so much attention, is because it’s a game changer for front end and layouts. With a few simple lines of code, we can now create imaginative, dynamic, responsive layouts (yep, I know that’s a lot of buzz words). While a lot of people are calling this the new ‘table layout’, grid gives us so much more, with the ability to spread cells across columns and rows to whatever size you choose, dictate which direction new items flow, allow cells to move around to fit in place and even tell certain cells exactly where they need to sit.\r\n\r\nWhile there is so much to worry about when developing an app, CSS Grid means that you can worry less about building the layout on the front end, and more about making sure the back end works well. Let me show you how the magic works.",

Domain modeling in particular is very specific with guidance on designing and coordinating the dance between the myriad moving parts in our system.  Yet learning the principals of DDD can be daunting for developers who are new to DDD. To encourage and enable more developers to get on the path of DDD, is it reasonable to allow a more pragmatic approach over a principled approach of adhering strictly to DDD guidelines? Should developers be encouraged to start with low hanging fruit which they can quickly benefit from in their software projects while they continue to learn, to gain a deeper understanding of Domain-Driven Design in order to evolve and adapt their practices as they move closer and closer to the beauty we all know that can be achieved with DDD.",

            "description": "Tell me if this sounds familiar: you have a web service, that calls another service, that sends a Kafka message to a third service, that writes something to a database. Except sometimes it doesn’t. Where did the message go? Did the client not send it? Or did Kafka eat it? You don’t know. You look in the logs, but there are so many logs! You try to reproduce the problem, but annoyingly everything works fine. What to do?\r\n\r\nIn this talk we’ll explore mechanisms for observing and debugging distributed systems, with an eye towards taking an existing codebase that lacks observability and evolving it over time. In particular, we’ll focus on distributed tracing tools that let us track transactions which span multiple services and execution contexts. We’ll discuss how tracing differs from logging and monitoring. How to instrument applications to emit trace data, how to collect and store it, how to visualize transactions, and how this benefits developers, devops, and the business itself. We’ll look at leveraging popular open source technologies, like the CNCF OpenTracing project, Jaeger, Zipkin, and the newly released Elastic APM OpenTracing bridge. \r\n",

            "description": "When we move from a monolith to microservices we abandon integrating via a shared database, as each service must own its own data to allow them it to be autonomous. But now we have a new problem, our data is distributed. What happens if I need one service needs to talk to another about a shared concept such as a product, a hotel room, or an order? Does every service need to have a list of all our users? Who knows what users have permissions to the entities within the micro service? What happens if my REST endpoint needs to include data from a graph that includes other services to make it responsive? And I am not breaking the boundary of my service when all of this data leaves my service boundary in response to a request?\r\n\r\nNaive request-based solutions result in chatty calls as each service engages with multiple other services to fulfil a request, or in large message payloads as services add all the data required to process a message to each message. Neither scale well.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Pat Helland wrote a paper ‘Data on the Inside vs. Data on the Outside’ which answers the question by distinguishing between data a service owns and reference data that it can use. Martin Fowler named the resulting architectural style; Event Driven Collaboration. This style is significant because it shifts the pattern from request to receiver-driven flow control. \r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will explain how events help us integrate our service architectures. We’ll provide examples in C#, Python and Go as well as using RMQ and Kafka.",

Using default creds, this malware spread itself on thousands of webcams and home routers and became one of the most disruptive DDOS tools in 2016. \r\nNow 3 years on, are we facing a new Mirai with the steady introduction of IPv6 and the number of private devices going online in this space increasing a massive rate? What do we need to consider as developers designing and developing applications for these IoT platforms? \r\nJoin Kristian as he walks you through how IPv6 will affect your security, and what you need to start doing to protect your code and create safer systems.\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nTalk 2: Root-of-trust - What it is and why you need one in IoT - Ole Konstad\r\n\r\nWhether you know it or not, if you have ever implemented any kind of digital security mechanism, your security is rooted somewhere. This is the root-of-trust (RoT) concept. This talk will elaborate on the RoT-concept, the various types of RoTs (one example being the TPM chip found in modern computers), how they can be used, typical implementations mistakes that can happen from the developer side and why you need one if you are deploying devices in IoT.\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nTalk 3: What hit my webservice with 408?! - Paweł Krzywicki\r\n\r\nOn a windy, cold night, a webservice hosted on a popular cloud provider was struck by a mysterious http request and surprisingly did not recover for half an hour. That event triggered an investigation that quickly reminded that if you start hosting a publicly available webservice, you immediately become a target for a number of scanners that relentlessly crawl the internet trying to find vulnerabilities.\r\nThis lightning talk discusses a real-world story of a certain message from such a massive scan that instead of failing gracefully with 404 response code (Not found) started to cause 408 (Request timeout), which poses a bigger threat of Denial of Service. \r\nThe investigation of the message showcased different methods of logging such suspects - both using cloud services, as well as Java application based - when they fail and when they succeed to log all the details required to reproduce the issue. Surprisingly, it also offered a way to optimize the load on the hosting infrastructure and offered an interesting insight into modern scans, as well as individual malware campaigns launched.\r\nThe talk includes also a demo of quick analyses of logged http requests\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nTalk 4: RSA encryption in 10 minutes - Fredrik Meyer\r\n\r\nAlways wanted to understand the idea and mathematics behind RSA encryption, but never had the will to read the Wikipedia article? In this lightning talk, I'll explain RSA encryption in an understandable way.\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nTalk 5: I thought we did things right until I went looking - Security errors in Norwegian websites - Håvard H. Pettersen\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about bug hunting? Well, here is how I got started, and how I ended up finding security issues in a couple of Norwegian companies' online systems.\r\n\r\n",

Most notable are the introduction of lambda expressions and stream processing libraries like LINQ in C# and the Stream API in Java, but other features are emerging as well. C# 7.0 introduced the concepts of tuples and pattern matching, both of which have for a long time been fundamental features of functional languages like Haskell. Why do people consider these features to be functional? And why are people with a background in functional programming thrilled to see these features introduced in the object-oriented world? This talk will focus on a set of case studies that illustrate how functional patterns are typically applied in Haskell and how solutions based on those patterns differ from the traditional OO approach. The talk does not assume a background in functional programming, but hold on to your hat and be prepared for something different!",

            "description": "Alan Turing's paper from 1936, where he describes what came to be known as the Turing machine, is one of the truly pivotal papers in the history of computer science. Turing's description of what he called the \"universal machine\" is frequently referred to as the starting point of the technological revolution we today call the computer. He wrote his paper during a time when the world was going through a dramatic set of upheavals both scientifically, technologically and politically, and his work is a prime example of how basic research of a seemingly esoteric problem can have far reaching consequences.\r\n\r\nAre you interested in learning more about Turing's ground breaking accomplishment? Then join me and hear the fascinating story of the Turing machine! I will describe both its historical context and its implications, but first and foremost I will explain the details of Turing's fictional machine and what he was trying to accomplish with it. This is the story of how a mathematician thought outside the box and accidentally changed the course of history! ",

            "description": "Picture this: you're a senior engineer at your company who, one day, is thrust into the architect role. Suddenly, you're having to think about things that you've never thought about - what's the difference between a microservice and a service bus? How do I design a scalable system for tomorrow without overengineering today?\r\n\r\nBetter yet, if you're at a startup, do all that - and still be responsible for code reviews, development, and coaching of junior devs. How can a fledgling architect possibly \"do it all\" - and more importantly, do it well?\r\n\r\nLuckily, someone has gone down that path (and is still going)... and he's ready to share his story.\r\n\r\nAttend Spencer's talk and hear about how he, as a senior engineer, had to grow into the architect role. We'll discuss the problems faced, the critical \"decision points\" he made from an architecture standpoint, the results of those choices, and how he helped guide the business through three architectural rewrites - all in a span of four years!",

In this talk, I will show an alternative approach on how to get started with Machine Learning by using a LEGO car as a model. By using Machine Learning, we can make the LEGO car steer autonomously!\r\n\r\nIn the process of making a LEGO car steer autonomously I will go through the following topics:\r\n- What is Machine Learning?\r\n- Can we make the LEGO car steer autonomously without Machine Learning?\r\n- How does the basic theory behind Machine Learning work?\r\n- How do we connect theory to LEGO bricks?\r\n\r\nThe aim of this talk is not to make you an expert in Machine Learning, however, it will hopefully inspire you to investigate and get familiar with Machine Learning in a playful and simple way.",

              "description": "Why would you ever want to introduce unmanaged code into your managed codebase when recent versions of C# have made writing high performance code in .NET more accessible than ever before? While C# has been pushing downwards into the realm of \"systems programming\", Rust, a language that already operates in this space, has been pushing upwards. The result isn't a competition where one language must emerge as more universally applicable than the other. It's a broader set of cases where C# and Rust can work together, and integrating them effectively is more idiomatic thanks to this broadening of scope.\r\n\r\nWhen we set out in 2018 to rebuild the storage engine for our log server, Seq, we decided to complement our existing C# codebase with a new one written in Rust. In this talk we'll look at why you might want to add unmanaged code to your managed codebase, using Seq as an example. We'll explore how to use the tools that .NET and Rust give us to design and build a safe and robust foreign function interface. In the end we'll have a new perspective on the implicit safety contracts we're expected to uphold in our purely managed codebases.",

Some of the best minds in the industry have been tuning these practices for years to ensure developers are able to implement proven, successful approaches to software design. Domain modeling in particular is very specific with guidance on designing and coordinating the dance between the myriad moving parts in our system.  Yet learning the principals of DDD can be daunting for developers who are new to DDD. To encourage and enable more developers to get on the path of DDD, is it reasonable to allow a more pragmatic approach over a principled approach of adhering strictly to DDD guidelines? Should developers be encouraged to start with low hanging fruit which they can quickly benefit from in their software projects while they continue to learn, to gain a deeper understanding of Domain-Driven Design in order to evolve and adapt their practices as they move closer and closer to the beauty we all know that can be achieved with DDD.",

We need to use JavaScript more responsibly, which means we must rely on native browser features where prudent, use HTML and CSS when appropriate, and know when too much JavaScript is just that: Too much. \r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll explore what happens to performance and accessibility when devices are inundated with more JavaScript than they can handle. We'll also dive into some novel techniques you can use to tailor delivery of scripts with respect to a person's device capabilities and network connection quality. When you walk out of this session, you'll be equipped with new knowledge to make your sites as fast as they are beautiful.",

Now I can teach you how to make those same mistakes!\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we'll see what a robust and reliable message pump with TPL and async looks like so we can avoid it. We'll examine asynchronous synchronization primitives which smarter people than I use to throttle requests, then compare and contrast different queuing technology message pumps to make sure we aren't building to each one's strengths.

Using default creds, this malware spread itself on thousands of webcams and home routers and became one of the most disruptive DDOS tools in 2016. \r\nNow 3 years on, are we facing a new Mirai with the steady introduction of IPv6 and the number of private devices going online in this space increasing a massive rate? What do we need to consider as developers designing and developing applications for these IoT platforms? \r\nJoin Kristian as he walks you through how IPv6 will affect your security, and what you need to start doing to protect your code and create safer systems.\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nTalk 2: Root-of-trust - What it is and why you need one in IoT - Ole Konstad\r\n\r\nWhether you know it or not, if you have ever implemented any kind of digital security mechanism, your security is rooted somewhere. This is the root-of-trust (RoT) concept. This talk will elaborate on the RoT-concept, the various types of RoTs (one example being the TPM chip found in modern computers), how they can be used, typical implementations mistakes that can happen from the developer side and why you need one if you are deploying devices in IoT.\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nTalk 3: What hit my webservice with 408?! - Paweł Krzywicki\r\n\r\nOn a windy, cold night, a webservice hosted on a popular cloud provider was struck by a mysterious http request and surprisingly did not recover for half an hour. That event triggered an investigation that quickly reminded that if you start hosting a publicly available webservice, you immediately become a target for a number of scanners that relentlessly crawl the internet trying to find vulnerabilities.\r\nThis lightning talk discusses a real-world story of a certain message from such a massive scan that instead of failing gracefully with 404 response code (Not found) started to cause 408 (Request timeout), which poses a bigger threat of Denial of Service. \r\nThe investigation of the message showcased different methods of logging such suspects - both using cloud services, as well as Java application based - when they fail and when they succeed to log all the details required to reproduce the issue. Surprisingly, it also offered a way to optimize the load on the hosting infrastructure and offered an interesting insight into modern scans, as well as individual malware campaigns launched.\r\nThe talk includes also a demo of quick analyses of logged http requests\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nTalk 4: RSA encryption in 10 minutes - Fredrik Meyer\r\n\r\nAlways wanted to understand the idea and mathematics behind RSA encryption, but never had the will to read the Wikipedia article? In this lightning talk, I'll explain RSA encryption in an understandable way.\r\n-----------------------------------\r\nTalk 5: I thought we did things right until I went looking - Security errors in Norwegian websites - Håvard H. Pettersen\r\n\r\nHave you ever thought about bug hunting? Well, here is how I got started, and how I ended up finding security issues in a couple of Norwegian companies' online systems.\r\n\r\n",

              "description": "Have you ever thought that you needed to be a programmer to do stream processing and build streaming data pipelines? Think again! Apache Kafka is a distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant streaming platform, providing low-latency pub-sub messaging coupled with native storage and stream processing capabilities. Integrating Kafka with RDBMS, NoSQL, and object stores is simple with Kafka Connect, which is part of Apache Kafka. KSQL is the open-source SQL streaming engine for Apache Kafka, and makes it possible to build stream processing applications at scale, written using a familiar SQL interface.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop you will hear the architectural reasoning for Apache Kafka and the benefits of real-time integration, and then build a streaming data pipeline using nothing but your bare hands, Kafka Connect, and KSQL.\r\n\r\nGasp as we filter events in real time! Be amazed at how we can enrich streams of data with data from RDBMS! Be astonished at the power of streaming aggregates for anomaly detection!\r\n\r\nPrerequisite \r\nParticipants must have their own laptop and complete the prerequisite steps detailed here PRIOR TO THE WORKSHOP:https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-scene/blob/master/ksql-workshop/pre-requisites.adoc.\r\n\r\nComputer Setup\r\nFor reasons of compatibility, we recommend the use of Mac or Linux for the workshop. 8GB memory is required. Knowledge of SQL is assumed. Participants will benefit from existing knowledge of the concepts of Kafka (topics, streaming, etc).",

              "description": "We’ve all heard a lot in the last year about a new advancement in the world of CSS, called CSS Grid. Starting off at whispers, we’re now starting to hear it as a deafening roar as more and more developers write about it, talk about it, share it and start using it. In the world of front end, I see it everywhere I turn and am excited as I start to use it in my own projects.\r\n\r\nBut what does this new CSS specification mean for software developers, and why should you care about it? In the world of tech today, we can do so many amazing things and use whatever language we choose across a wide range of devices and platforms. Whether it’s the advent of React and React Native, or frameworks like Electron, it’s easier than ever to build one app that works on multiple platforms with the language we know and work with best. The ability to do this also expands to styling apps on any platform using CSS, and therefore being able to utilise the magical thing that is\r\nCSS Grid.\r\n\r\nThe reason CSS Grid is gaining so much attention, is because it’s a game changer for front end and layouts. With a few simple lines of code, we can now create imaginative, dynamic, responsive layouts (yep, I know that’s a lot of buzz words). While a lot of people are calling this the new ‘table layout’, grid gives us so much more, with the ability to spread cells across columns and rows to whatever size you choose, dictate which direction new items flow, allow cells to move around to fit in place and even tell certain cells exactly where they need to sit.\r\n\r\nWhile there is so much to worry about when developing an app, CSS Grid means that you can worry less about building the layout on the front end, and more about making sure the back end works well. Let me show you how the magic works.",

Except sometimes it doesn’t. Where did the message go? Did the client not send it? Or did Kafka eat it? You don’t know. You look in the logs, but there are so many logs! You try to reproduce the problem, but annoyingly everything works fine. What to do?\r\n\r\nIn this talk we’ll explore mechanisms for observing and debugging distributed systems, with an eye towards taking an existing codebase that lacks observability and evolving it over time. In particular, we’ll focus on distributed tracing tools that let us track transactions which span multiple services and execution contexts. We’ll discuss how tracing differs from logging and monitoring. How to instrument applications to emit trace data, how to collect and store it, how to visualize transactions, and how this benefits developers, devops, and the business itself. We’ll look at leveraging popular open source technologies, like the CNCF OpenTracing project, Jaeger, Zipkin, and the newly released Elastic APM OpenTracing bridge. \r\n",

Apache Kafka is a distributed, scalable, and fault-tolerant streaming platform, providing low-latency pub-sub messaging coupled with native storage and stream processing capabilities. Integrating Kafka with RDBMS, NoSQL, and object stores is simple with Kafka Connect, which is part of Apache Kafka. KSQL is the open-source SQL streaming engine for Apache Kafka, and makes it possible to build stream processing applications at scale, written using a familiar SQL interface.\r\n\r\nIn this workshop you will hear the architectural reasoning for Apache Kafka and the benefits of real-time integration, and then build a streaming data pipeline using nothing but your bare hands, Kafka Connect, and KSQL.\r\n\r\nGasp as we filter events in real time! Be amazed at how we can enrich streams of data with data from RDBMS! Be astonished at the power of streaming aggregates for anomaly detection!\r\n\r\nPrerequisite \r\nParticipants must have their own laptop and complete the prerequisite steps detailed here PRIOR TO THE WORKSHOP:https://github.com/confluentinc/demo-scene/blob/master/ksql-workshop/pre-requisites.adoc.\r\n\r\nComputer Setup\r\nFor reasons of compatibility, we recommend the use of Mac or Linux for the workshop. 8GB memory is required.Knowledge of SQL is assumed.

              "description": "Automatic text summarization is the process of shortening a text document by automatically creating a short, accurate, and fluent summary with the main points of the original document using software. It is a common problem in machine learning and natural language processing.  \r\n\r\nSince humans have the capacity to understand the meaning of a text document and extract the most important information from the original source using their own words, we are generally quite good at making summaries of a text. However, manual creation of summaries is very time consuming, and therefore a need for automatic summary has arisen. Not only are the automatic summarization tools much faster, they are also less biased than humans. \r\n\r\nNowadays, there are several methods of text summary, but there are two basic approaches to text summary that are based on the output type: extractive and abstractive. In an extractive summary, the most important sentences are extracted and joined to get a brief summary. The abstract text summary algorithms create new sentences and sentences that provide the most useful information from the original text - just as humans do. \r\n\r\nThis lecture provides insight into most common algorithms and tools used for automatic text summarization today, together with the methods used to evaluate automated summaries. \r\n",

              "description": "Git has become the de-facto version control system of our industry, and for good reason. What you're able to achieve with Git is unmatched by any other version control system that came before it. But for all its power and flexibility, Git has one terrible flaw: its complexity. You won't find me arguing with that. However, I don't believe that Git is hard to understand. In fact, it's quite the opposite — Git is surprisingly simple at its core. The key to unlock its power is to understand it at a fundamental level.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll do just that by going through how Git works from the ground up. We'll start out by understanding Git's fundamental concepts and how they're implemented in the object model. From there, we'll work our way up to the user-facing commands and learn to take advantage of Git's unique features to craft a beautiful history without having to compromise on our working style.\r\n\r\nIf you ever wished you knew how Git really works, come to this session and find out.",

              "description": "When we move from a monolith to microservices we abandon integrating via a shared database, as each service must own its own data to allow them it to be autonomous. But now we have a new problem, our data is distributed. What happens if I need one service needs to talk to another about a shared concept such as a product, a hotel room, or an order? Does every service need to have a list of all our users? Who knows what users have permissions to the entities within the micro service? What happens if my REST endpoint needs to include data from a graph that includes other services to make it responsive? And I am not breaking the boundary of my service when all of this data leaves my service boundary in response to a request?\r\n\r\nNaive request-based solutions result in chatty calls as each service engages with multiple other services to fulfil a request, or in large message payloads as services add all the data required to process a message to each message. Neither scale well.\r\n\r\nIn 2005, Pat Helland wrote a paper ‘Data on the Inside vs. Data on the Outside’ which answers the question by distinguishing between data a service owns and reference data that it can use. Martin Fowler named the resulting architectural style; Event Driven Collaboration. This style is significant because it shifts the pattern from request to receiver-driven flow control. \r\n\r\nIn this presentation we will explain how events help us integrate our service architectures. We’ll provide examples in C#, Python and Go as well as using RMQ and Kafka.",

We’ll see how recent versions of C# allow using structs without creating lots of copies, and we’ll have a timely reminder on exactly what is the difference between a class and a struct. We’ll also spend some time with the new Span&lt;T&gt; runtime type and find out how that can help work with slices of existing memory, and how it’s already into the types we know and love in the framework.

He wrote his paper during a time when the world was going through a dramatic set of upheavals both scientifically, technologically and politically, and his work is a prime example of how basic research of a seemingly esoteric problem can have far reaching consequences.\r\n\r\nAre you interested in learning more about Turing's ground breaking accomplishment? Then join me and hear the fascinating story of the Turing machine! I will describe both its historical context and its implications, but first and foremost I will explain the details of Turing's fictional machine and what he was trying to accomplish with it.

The Clang APIs necessarily form a more-exact picture of the structure of C++ code than most developers keep in their heads, and bridging the conceptual gap can be a daunting task.\r\n\r\nTooling supplied with clang-tidy, such as clang-query, are indispensable in the discovery of the Clang AST.\r\n\r\nThis talk will show recent and future features in Clang tooling, as well as Tips, Tricks and Traps encountered on the journey to quality refactoring tools.

Most notable are the introduction of lambda expressions and stream processing libraries like LINQ in C# and the Stream API in Java, but other features are emerging as well. C# 7.0 introduced the concepts of tuples and pattern matching, both of which have for a long time been fundamental features of functional languages like Haskell. Why do people consider these features to be functional? And why are people with a background in functional programming thrilled to see these features introduced in the object-oriented world? This talk will focus on a set of case studies that illustrate how functional patterns are typically applied in Haskell and how solutions based on those patterns differ from the traditional OO approach. The talk does not assume a background in functional programming, but hold on to your hat and be prepared for something different!",

How do I design a scalable system for tomorrow without overengineering today?\r\n\r\nBetter yet, if you're at a startup, do all that - and still be responsible for code reviews, development, and coaching of junior devs. How can a fledgling architect possibly \"do it all\" - and more importantly, do it well?\r\n\r\nLuckily, someone has gone down that path (and is still going)... and he's ready to share his story.\r\n\r\nAttend Spencer's talk and hear about how he, as a senior engineer, had to grow into the architect role. We'll discuss the problems faced, the critical \"decision points\" he made from an architecture standpoint, the results of those choices, and how he helped guide the business through three architectural rewrites - all in a span of four years!",

After all, IoT devices collect mountains of sensor data, what better way to uncover insights and actions than through sophisticated, modern computing methods like ML and AI?\r\n\r\nThe problem is, leveraging ML with IoT has historically meant backhauling all your sensor data to the Cloud. When the cloud is involved, security is a concern, and in the realm of IoT, security is often a dirty word.\r\n\r\nBut modern embedded systems, microcontrollers and single-board computers are getting more powerful, and more sophisticated, and its becoming increasingly possible to bring Machine Learning closer to sensors and IoT devices. \"Edge ML\" enables quicker insights, tighter security, and even true predictive action, and it's going to become the norm in the IoT in the near future.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll explore the state of the art in Edge ML and IoT, and talk about practical ways that developers can get started with both, today.",

Very precise definition, but might be confusing at first. What 'light-weight thread' means? How does suspension work? This talk uncovers the magic.\r\nWe'll discuss the concept of coroutines, the power of async/await, and how you can benefit from defining your asynchronous computations using suspend functions.",

Are the major structures and technology choices the result of conscious decisions, or have they emerged as the system has evolved? Architecture is often an ad hoc, responsive process where designs get stuck in local minima while ever more features are piled into the system. Such systems often fail to live up to the origin vision and expectations of stakeholders.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we look at how to design systems which are a purely a function of the major forces acting on a solution, rather than being modishly reflective of the prevailing software zeitgeist. We’ll explore the idea that software architecture, and hence software architects, should focus deliberately on the constraints and qualities of system design, and avoid getting too distracted by features.",

We will shine a light on the mathematical notion of Affine Spaces, and how they guide stronger design. We will review the properties of affine spaces and show how they improve program semantics, stronger type safety and compile time enforcement of these semantics.\r\n\r\nBy showing motivational examples, we will introduce you to the mathematical notion of affine spaces. The main focus will then be on how affine space types and their well defined semantics shape expressive APIs.\r\n\r\nWe will give examples and guidelines for creating your own affine types.

But what if there were an actual byte-code language you could compile your non-JavaScript code to instead? That is what WebAssembly is.\r\n\r\nI'm going to explain how WebAssembly works and how to use it in this talk. I'll cover what it is, how it fits into your application, and how to build and use your own WebAssembly modules. And, I'll demo how to build and use those modules with Rust, C++, and the WebAssembly Text Format. That's right, I'll be live coding in an assembly language. I'll also go over some online resources for other languages and tools that make use of WebAssembly.\r\n\r\nWhen we're done, you'll have the footing you need to start building applications featuring WebAssembly.

We stop, we fix, we repeat and refine. Like elite musicians, dedicated technical presenters typically spend many solitary hours doing this, which of course is necessary to master any content. But none of these practice processes has a place on the presentation stage. In presentation we must trust, believe, create, and keep going in the face of any adversity – a completely different process which in itself must be rehearsed.  \r\nIn order to give a magnificent presentation, we must PRACTICE giving a magnificent presentation. The only way to do this is by regularly and deliberately creating pressure situations in which we can practice NOT committing the presentation sins.\r\n\r\nCovering everything from wrong notes to blue screens of death, this dynamic and multi-talented pair not only break down the elements of successful and unsuccessful presentations, but also outline how one can give a truly engaging presentation every time, no matter how basic or complex the content.",

            "description": "How do you make a design system empathetic and whom should it be empathetic towards? At a recent company, we decided to replace our outdated style guide with a newfangled design system that we started from scratch. And we made a great start.\r\n\r\nBut we forgot about accessibility. Only stand alone components reflected the basics of accessibility leaving full user flows behind. We forgot about our fellow coworkers and peers. Our engineers shouldered slow development times and new technologies, designs changed often, and variants were hard to implement. And we forgot about our users. Much of the design system was geared towards engineers, neglecting designers, product managers and more.\r\n\r\nSo what did we learn in our first iteration? How did empathy help shape our ever-changing, morphing design system? Come learn how to build an empathetic design system from the ground up or start incorporating empathy today!\r\n",

            "description": "When building software, we often need to associate metadata with the code we’re writing. A typical example is when we need to tell our linters to ignore a specific range of code. A common approach to adding this metadata is to embed it directly in the code using the syntax of the language, but this approach has a number of drawbacks including language specificity, potential for collision, and cluttering of the code.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we’ll look at an alternative approach that stores the metadata separate from the code using a technique called _anchoring_. The metadata is associated with an anchor, a region of code inside the source file. Critically, the anchor also includes a context, a snapshot of the code surrounding the anchored region. As the source code is changed, this context – along with some very interesting algorithms for aligning text -– is used to automatically update the anchors.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate these concepts we’ll look at spor, a tool that implements anchoring and anchor updating. The primary implementation of spor is in Python, so it’s very approachable and, indeed, open for contribution. As a side note, we’ll also look at a partial implementation of spor written in Rust. Finally, we’ll look at how spor is being used in Cosmic Ray, a mutation testing tool for Python.",

My team has been using Cosmos DB on a system that requires both high levels of performance and uptime. After hours of design sessions, experimentation, performance testing, rewriting the document structure, using new partition keys, faking consistency in the application and several other attempts to make it work for us, we felt that CosmosDB was a bad fit for our use case. The system we work on is in production, and my experience is based on real-world usage.\r\n\r\nThis lightning talk will explain some of the issues we faced, what we learned and give some advice on using Cosmos DB. It won’t be all doom and gloom, and you'll even hear some scenarios were Cosmos DB is a perfect match.\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 2: How we messed everything up but still got LoRa to the stratosphere - Sindre Lindstad\r\n\r\nBack in the early 2010's people were sending all sorts of tech trash into space using helium balloons and styrofoam boxes.\r\n\r\nA friend and I decided we wanted to do the same thing, but by making everything from scratch. All the way from the PCB's and antennas, down to the web API's and map applications to track it.\r\n\r\nAnd we... sort of made it.\r\n\r\nThis is a story about technology, friendship, and lots and lots of duct tape.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 3: Mobile AR in 10 minutes - Kristina Simakova\r\n\r\nA crash course into mobile AR. This talk will give you an overview and a current status on mobile AR technology and SDKs, its new features and shortcomings.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 4: I didn't know that - Stefan Judis\r\n\r\n Web Development is a constant journey of new technologies and new things to learn. A year ago I started documenting and sharing all the tiny things that I didn't know before and stopped being anxious about others thinking that I'm not smart. \r\n\r\nLet me tell you what I learned about JavaScript!\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 5: What's cooking for JavaScript: a look at current TC39 proposals - Branislav Jenco\r\n\r\nIn this lightning talk, I go over the current proposals for new language features in JavaScript and their current status. Pipelines, decorators, null coalescing and more is coming, but when? And how will it look like?\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------",

            "description": "At Spacemaker, we are building a product for real estate developers and architects leveraging AI methodologies and massive computing power to maximize the potential of any building site. At the core of our platform's AI engine, we have CPU-intensive optimization and search algorithms, memory-demanding simulations, and GPU-optimized machine learning and computer graphics techniques None of these components, however, are equal in terms of resource requirements. Depending on the input size, some components complete within a couple of milliseconds using one CPU, while other components have run time of hours even with several hundred CPUs. Finally, one of our core values at Spacemaker's is the complete autonomy of every product team. This autonomy enables the teams to make their own choices regarding programming languages and libraries but also on their general approach to the problems on hand.\r\n\r\nThe challenges outlined above requires a really flexible pipeline. We have, therefore, replaced our old batch-oriented pipeline with an asynchronous, message-based pipelined built on Kubernetes and Google Pub/Sub. At the core of this pipeline, we find a central message broker that dispatches units of work onto a set of queues, where the broker takes care of task dependencies and ensures the pipeline executions run to their completion. The dispatched tasks are processed by a set of workers deployed to a shared, auto-scaled Kubernetes cluster. This offers elasticity and scalability for the workers and their respective resource requirements. By structuring the pipeline in this way the teams are free to develop individual components using whichever programming languages and tools they see fit, allowing for each component to have different resource requirements.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation I will start off with presenting our old, batch oriented pipeline, discussing why it needed replacement and the research leading up to the design of our new pipeline. I will then elaborate further on the details of our auto-scaling including how we handle the burst workloads by adding new resources to our Kubernetes cluster based on the queue lengths for the workers. Then, I will dig into the details of our message broker, the API and the code used in our pipeline workers. Finally I will wrap-up my presentation highlighting som key performance results and my thoughts on the potential surrounding modularizing a pipeline to enable more general use cases.",

            "description": "Over a decade ago, Pat Helland authored his paper, \"Life Beyond Distributed Transactions: An Apostate's Opinion\" describing a means to coordinate activities between entities in databases when a transaction encompassing those entities wasn't feasible or possible. While the paper and subsequent talks provided great insight in the challenges of coordinating activities across entities in a single database, implementations were left as an exercise to the reader!\r\n\r\nFast forward to today, and now we have NoSQL databases, microservices, message queues and brokers, HTTP web services and more that don't (and shouldn't) support any kind of distributed transaction.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll look at how to implement coordination between non-transactional resources using Pat's paper as a guide, with examples in Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Service Bus, and Azure SQL Server. We'll look at a real-world example where a codebase assumed everything would be transactional and always succeed, but production proved us wrong! Finally, we'll look at advanced coordination workflows such as Sagas to achieve robust, scalable coordination across the enterprise.",

With our users expecting new functionality to be shipped ever more frequently than before, we no longer have the luxury of a complete system rebuild. In fact, a Big Bang migration of a Monolithic architecture into a microservice architecture can be especially problematic, as we’ll explore in this talk.\r\nWe want to ship features, but we also want to change our architecture - and many of us want to be able to break down existing systems into microservice architectures. But how do you do this while still shipping features?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll share with you some key principles and a number of patterns which you can use to incrementally decompose an existing system into microservices. I’ll even cover off patterns that can work to migrate functionality out of systems you can’t change, making them useful when working with very old systems or vendor products. We'll look at the use of stranger patterns, change data capture, database decomposition and more.",

Clearly several organizations think so, as many compliance regimes require its usage, and most secure development guidance recommend it. In reality adopting static analysis into a development process is incredibly challenging, and can easily both fail to meet security objections and enrage the software engineers.  This talk draws on many painful lessons learned deploying static analysis in several engineering organizations, with the goal of helping the audience better evaluate tools in the space, and have higher success deploying them.",

Then we’ll investigate some simple methods to find patterns in user behaviour, such as login times and mouse behaviour, to detect anomalies and take action.\r\n\r\nFinally, we’ll see how machine learning can be used to identify fraudulent text or photoshopped images within webpages and warn users of scams before it becomes an issue.",

We use hyperlinks to provide affordances for clients: instead of just exposing individual endpoints that serve data, we offer navigation options that form user stories that adapt dynamically based on different scenarios and application states. Hyperlinks also allow us to tie together bounded domain contexts that we keep separate to contain complexity. Clients can seamlessly navigate between e.g. editorial content, catalog, playback and personalized recommendations, without noticing or caring that different contexts could be supported by separate applications with varying degrees of criticality and separate failure modes. That sounds all sweet and dandy, but I'll back these pretty words up with practical examples taken from our API, and share some experiences and lessons learned.",

This is a talk intended for all parts of an organisation to really help understand what metrics can do for us and why a metric may not mean what you believe it does\r\n\r\nBehind every vanity metric is a real metric that can help us understand the health of our company - whether it be the ability to understand our users or the ability to understand the value of a feature\r\n\r\nWe just need to step back and think about what it actually is...",

            "description": "The Norwegian government has made “necessary for some, good for everyone” a mantra of a new movement that aims to ensure that everyone can participate in society. One of the ways the government has tried to achieve this aim is through universal design. Universal design is the idea that the buildings as well as digital solutions can be made accessible to all people, regardless of age, disability, or other factors. In Norway, universal design is a legal obligation for all public service providers. It’s also good for business as including new untapped forms or revenue and market segments can help broaden a product or services appeal. However, according to the Norwegian government, public and private service providers have not yet fully adopted universal design as in the design and development of software systems.\r\n\r\nThe government agency, Difi, recently reported that one website stood out as an useful example of how universal design could be implemented in practice. The official website of the Norwegian police, politet.no, one of Bouvet’s clients gave us permission to present how this project took the grand challenge of universal design and made it part of the DNA of their website.  The project team integrated a universal design approach in the development process from beginning to end. \r\nThis process provides an good practice approach for using universal design not only set an example for other businesses and government agencies, but to reach all of their citizens equally no matter their age or disability. \r\n\r\nOne of the great myths of universal design is that it is difficult to prioritize with all the other high demands that organizations face and that it will be expensive.  However by integrating a universal design approach in technology development, software engineers and programmers have the opportunity to create low cost and easily deployable solutions for achieving universal design. As a result, their products and services enjoy greater usability, a better user experience and a truly equal approach to creating new technology.\r\n",

            "description": "Empathy is a fundamental part of human interaction. When we communicate by email or at conferences, or indirectly, when we create products, events, or do a talk. However, our understanding of other people is full of error, and worse, bias. This can lead us to make communities and products that work poorly for people that are different from ourselves, introduce confusion and misunderstanding, exclude people unintentionally, and sometimes even cause harm.\r\n\r\nHowever, our communities are an opportunity to learn as well. To embrace our diversity, and expand our understanding of other people's worlds. To gain understanding of other people’s situations, experiences and emotions, which can be dramatically different to ours. And how we can use this to create both products and communities which work great not only for ourselves, but also those that we more easily forget about. As creators in tech we have such tremendous power to create change, but merely our best intentions will not be enough for that.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore how and why we sometimes have such difficulty to understand others, and how others can have difficulty to understand us. We'll talk about why other people's experiences, emotion and perceptions can be so different. Both for the world as a whole, but also with the speaker's personal experiences. Finally, we'll cover specific ways for us to understand others better, and associated pitfalls, to make our communities and products happy, inviting and supportive places.\r\n\r\nPrevious attendees of this talk said:\r\n\r\n- \"I think this touched the very core of the complexity of empathy and vulnerability\"\r\n- \"I feel safe in this community, and talks like this are one of the main reasons.\"\r\n- \"Having a talk about such a difficult topic makes you a great role model in general to me!\"\r\n- \"Your talk made me feel so much more welcome and safe at this event.\"\r\n- \"As usual, she's delivering an amazing talk.\"\r\n- \"Great speech, really important and meaningful.\"\r\n- \"Awesome, awesome talk.\"",

Used in C# for quite a while already, it has proven to be extremely useful. In Kotlin you have async and await as library functions implemented using coroutines.\r\n\r\nA coroutine is a light-weight thread that can be suspended and resumed later. Very precise definition, but might be confusing at first. What 'light-weight thread' means? How does suspension work? This talk uncovers the magic.\r\nWe'll discuss the concept of coroutines, the power of async/await, and how you can benefit from defining your asynchronous computations using suspend functions.",

While there have been various attempts to dethrone it, they have typically involved treating JavaScript as an assembly-language analog that you transpile your code to. This has lead to complex build pipelines that result in JavaScript which the browser has to parse and *you* still have to debug. But what if there were an actual byte-code language you could compile your non-JavaScript code to instead? That is what WebAssembly is.\r\n\r\nI'm going to explain how WebAssembly works and how to use it in this talk. I'll cover what it is, how it fits into your application, and how to build and use your own WebAssembly modules. And, I'll demo how to build and use those modules with Rust, C++, and the WebAssembly Text Format. That's right, I'll be live coding in an assembly language. I'll also go over some online resources for other languages and tools that make use of WebAssembly.\r\n\r\nWhen we're done, you'll have the footing you need to start building applications featuring WebAssembly. So grab a non-JavaScript language, a modern browser, and let's and get started!",

              "description": "At Spacemaker, we are building a product for real estate developers and architects leveraging AI methodologies and massive computing power to maximize the potential of any building site. At the core of our platform's AI engine, we have CPU-intensive optimization and search algorithms, memory-demanding simulations, and GPU-optimized machine learning and computer graphics techniques None of these components, however, are equal in terms of resource requirements. Depending on the input size, some components complete within a couple of milliseconds using one CPU, while other components have run time of hours even with several hundred CPUs. Finally, one of our core values at Spacemaker's is the complete autonomy of every product team. This autonomy enables the teams to make their own choices regarding programming languages and libraries but also on their general approach to the problems on hand.\r\n\r\nThe challenges outlined above requires a really flexible pipeline. We have, therefore, replaced our old batch-oriented pipeline with an asynchronous, message-based pipelined built on Kubernetes and Google Pub/Sub. At the core of this pipeline, we find a central message broker that dispatches units of work onto a set of queues, where the broker takes care of task dependencies and ensures the pipeline executions run to their completion. The dispatched tasks are processed by a set of workers deployed to a shared, auto-scaled Kubernetes cluster. This offers elasticity and scalability for the workers and their respective resource requirements. By structuring the pipeline in this way the teams are free to develop individual components using whichever programming languages and tools they see fit, allowing for each component to have different resource requirements.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation I will start off with presenting our old, batch oriented pipeline, discussing why it needed replacement and the research leading up to the design of our new pipeline. I will then elaborate further on the details of our auto-scaling including how we handle the burst workloads by adding new resources to our Kubernetes cluster based on the queue lengths for the workers. Then, I will dig into the details of our message broker, the API and the code used in our pipeline workers. Finally I will wrap-up my presentation highlighting som key performance results and my thoughts on the potential surrounding modularizing a pipeline to enable more general use cases.",

While the paper and subsequent talks provided great insight in the challenges of coordinating activities across entities in a single database, implementations were left as an exercise to the reader!\r\n\r\nFast forward to today, and now we have NoSQL databases, microservices, message queues and brokers, HTTP web services and more that don't (and shouldn't) support any kind of distributed transaction.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll look at how to implement coordination between non-transactional resources using Pat's paper as a guide, with examples in Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Service Bus, and Azure SQL Server. We'll look at a real-world example where a codebase assumed everything would be transactional and always succeed, but production proved us wrong! Finally, we'll look at advanced coordination workflows such as Sagas to achieve robust, scalable coordination across the enterprise.",

Navigating the waters of AI, machine learning and data analysis can be tricky, especially when being sold by the myriad of data science and AI companies offering solutions at the enterprise level. But fear not, some simple guidelines can help. In this talk, I will present a basic rubric for evaluating AI and data analytics techniques as potential solutions for enterprise business problems.",

More importantly, what are the elements that can destroy a great presentation, even if the content itself is technically sound? \r\n\r\nIn this session Samantha and Andrew Coates demonstrate seven sins that must not be committed in a presentation, why and how a presentation can suffer from committing them, and how to avoid accidently committing them. \r\n\r\nIronically, when we practice we deliberately commit presentation sins. We stop, we fix, we repeat and refine. Like elite musicians, dedicated technical presenters typically spend many solitary hours doing this, which of course is necessary to master any content. But none of these practice processes has a place on the presentation stage. In presentation we must trust, believe, create, and keep going in the face of any adversity – a completely different process which in itself must be rehearsed.  \r\nIn order to give a magnificent presentation, we must PRACTICE giving a magnificent presentation. The only way to do this is by regularly and deliberately creating pressure situations in which we can practice NOT committing the presentation sins.\r\n\r\nCovering everything from wrong notes to blue screens of death, this dynamic and multi-talented pair not only break down the elements of successful and unsuccessful presentations, but also outline how one can give a truly engaging presentation every time, no matter how basic or complex the content.",

My team has been using Cosmos DB on a system that requires both high levels of performance and uptime. After hours of design sessions, experimentation, performance testing, rewriting the document structure, using new partition keys, faking consistency in the application and several other attempts to make it work for us, we felt that CosmosDB was a bad fit for our use case. The system we work on is in production, and my experience is based on real-world usage.\r\n\r\nThis lightning talk will explain some of the issues we faced, what we learned and give some advice on using Cosmos DB. It won’t be all doom and gloom, and you'll even hear some scenarios were Cosmos DB is a perfect match.\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 2: How we messed everything up but still got LoRa to the stratosphere - Sindre Lindstad\r\n\r\nBack in the early 2010's people were sending all sorts of tech trash into space using helium balloons and styrofoam boxes.\r\n\r\nA friend and I decided we wanted to do the same thing, but by making everything from scratch. All the way from the PCB's and antennas, down to the web API's and map applications to track it.\r\n\r\nAnd we... sort of made it.\r\n\r\nThis is a story about technology, friendship, and lots and lots of duct tape.\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 3: Mobile AR in 10 minutes - Kristina Simakova\r\n\r\nA crash course into mobile AR. This talk will give you an overview and a current status on mobile AR technology and SDKs, its new features and shortcomings.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 4: I didn't know that - Stefan Judis\r\n\r\n Web Development is a constant journey of new technologies and new things to learn. A year ago I started documenting and sharing all the tiny things that I didn't know before and stopped being anxious about others thinking that I'm not smart. \r\n\r\nLet me tell you what I learned about JavaScript!\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 5: What's cooking for JavaScript: a look at current TC39 proposals - Branislav Jenco\r\n\r\nIn this lightning talk, I go over the current proposals for new language features in JavaScript and their current status. Pipelines, decorators, null coalescing and more is coming, but when? And how will it look like?\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------",

With our users expecting new functionality to be shipped ever more frequently than before, we no longer have the luxury of a complete system rebuild. In fact, a Big Bang migration of a Monolithic architecture into a microservice architecture can be especially problematic, as we’ll explore in this talk.\r\nWe want to ship features, but we also want to change our architecture - and many of us want to be able to break down existing systems into microservice architectures. But how do you do this while still shipping features?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll share with you some key principles and a number of patterns which you can use to incrementally decompose an existing system into microservices. I’ll even cover off patterns that can work to migrate functionality out of systems you can’t change, making them useful when working with very old systems or vendor products. We'll look at the use of stranger patterns, change data capture, database decomposition and more.",

That’s fine, but there’s no good reason to limit our industry to basically one language when so many powerful and mature alternate languages and programming platforms exist. Starting now, WebAssembly opens the floodgates to new choices, and one of the first realistic options may be .NET.\r\n\r\nBlazor is a new experimental web UI framework from the ASP.NET team that aims to brings .NET applications into all browsers (including mobile) via WebAssembly. It allows you to build true full-stack .NET applications, sharing code across server and client, with no need for transpilation or plugins.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I’ll demonstrate what you can do with Blazor today and how it works on the underlying WebAssembly runtime behind the scenes. You’ll see its modern, component-based architecture (inspired by modern SPA frameworks) at work as we use it to build a responsive client-side UI. I’ll cover both basic and advanced scenarios using Blazor’s components, router, DI system, JavaScript interop, and more.",

              "description": "At NRK TV we are gradually introducing hypermedia in the API that serves the clients our viewers use to stream our TV content. Why? Not out of idealism, but because it provides concrete benefits for our service. We use hyperlinks to provide affordances for clients: instead of just exposing individual endpoints that serve data, we offer navigation options that form user stories that adapt dynamically based on different scenarios and application states. Hyperlinks also allow us to tie together bounded domain contexts that we keep separate to contain complexity. Clients can seamlessly navigate between e.g. editorial content, catalog, playback and personalized recommendations, without noticing or caring that different contexts could be supported by separate applications with varying degrees of criticality and separate failure modes. That sounds all sweet and dandy, but I'll back these pretty words up with practical examples taken from our API, and share some experiences and lessons learned.",

              "description": "The Norwegian government has made “necessary for some, good for everyone” a mantra of a new movement that aims to ensure that everyone can participate in society. One of the ways the government has tried to achieve this aim is through universal design. Universal design is the idea that the buildings as well as digital solutions can be made accessible to all people, regardless of age, disability, or other factors. In Norway, universal design is a legal obligation for all public service providers. It’s also good for business as including new untapped forms or revenue and market segments can help broaden a product or services appeal. However, according to the Norwegian government, public and private service providers have not yet fully adopted universal design as in the design and development of software systems.\r\n\r\nThe government agency, Difi, recently reported that one website stood out as an useful example of how universal design could be implemented in practice. The official website of the Norwegian police, politet.no, one of Bouvet’s clients gave us permission to present how this project took the grand challenge of universal design and made it part of the DNA of their website.  The project team integrated a universal design approach in the development process from beginning to end. \r\nThis process provides an good practice approach for using universal design not only set an example for other businesses and government agencies, but to reach all of their citizens equally no matter their age or disability. \r\n\r\nOne of the great myths of universal design is that it is difficult to prioritize with all the other high demands that organizations face and that it will be expensive.  However by integrating a universal design approach in technology development, software engineers and programmers have the opportunity to create low cost and easily deployable solutions for achieving universal design. As a result, their products and services enjoy greater usability, a better user experience and a truly equal approach to creating new technology.\r\n",

The programming is not very advanced, however it will teach you how to read data and share online for the data to be used for latter visualization. All participants will get a goodiebag to be soldered, programmed and brought back home. The goodiebag contains a ESP8266 micro controller, moisture sensor and a personally designed circuit board.

Are the major structures and technology choices the result of conscious decisions, or have they emerged as the system has evolved? Architecture is often an ad hoc, responsive process where designs get stuck in local minima while ever more features are piled into the system. Such systems often fail to live up to the origin vision and expectations of stakeholders.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we look at how to design systems which are a purely a function of the major forces acting on a solution, rather than being modishly reflective of the prevailing software zeitgeist. We’ll explore the idea that software architecture, and hence software architects, should focus deliberately on the constraints and qualities of system design, and avoid getting too distracted by features.",

Only stand alone components reflected the basics of accessibility leaving full user flows behind. We forgot about our fellow coworkers and peers. Our engineers shouldered slow development times and new technologies, designs changed often, and variants were hard to implement. And we forgot about our users. Much of the design system was geared towards engineers, neglecting designers, product managers and more.\r\n\r\nSo what did we learn in our first iteration?

Important kriterias was speed, modern and automated processes and future-proofing. In addition we wanted to make something that was cool and motivated everyone on the team to work on.\r\n\r\nThe choice landed on Google Kubernetes Engine and Google Firebase and the possibilities this gives us are literally endless! And it gives us the opportunity to move fast while having a more or less fully managed environment that is always up and running!\r\n\r\nWe have decided to model payments entirely event based and asynchronously where multiple microservices written in Go each do their part before handing over the transaction to the next service over a message queue.",

              "description": "Empathy is a fundamental part of human interaction. When we communicate by email or at conferences, or indirectly, when we create products, events, or do a talk. However, our understanding of other people is full of error, and worse, bias. This can lead us to make communities and products that work poorly for people that are different from ourselves, introduce confusion and misunderstanding, exclude people unintentionally, and sometimes even cause harm.\r\n\r\nHowever, our communities are an opportunity to learn as well. To embrace our diversity, and expand our understanding of other people's worlds. To gain understanding of other people’s situations, experiences and emotions, which can be dramatically different to ours. And how we can use this to create both products and communities which work great not only for ourselves, but also those that we more easily forget about. As creators in tech we have such tremendous power to create change, but merely our best intentions will not be enough for that.\r\n\r\nThis talk will explore how and why we sometimes have such difficulty to understand others, and how others can have difficulty to understand us. We'll talk about why other people's experiences, emotion and perceptions can be so different. Both for the world as a whole, but also with the speaker's personal experiences. Finally, we'll cover specific ways for us to understand others better, and associated pitfalls, to make our communities and products happy, inviting and supportive places.\r\n\r\nPrevious attendees of this talk said:\r\n\r\n- \"I think this touched the very core of the complexity of empathy and vulnerability\"\r\n- \"I feel safe in this community, and talks like this are one of the main reasons.\"\r\n- \"Having a talk about such a difficult topic makes you a great role model in general to me!\"\r\n- \"Your talk made me feel so much more welcome and safe at this event.\"\r\n- \"As usual, she's delivering an amazing talk.\"\r\n- \"Great speech, really important and meaningful.\"\r\n- \"Awesome, awesome talk.\"",

We will shine a light on the mathematical notion of Affine Spaces, and how they guide stronger design. We will review the properties of affine spaces and show how they improve program semantics, stronger type safety and compile time enforcement of these semantics.\r\n\r\nBy showing motivational examples, we will introduce you to the mathematical notion of affine spaces. The main focus will then be on how affine space types and their well defined semantics shape expressive APIs.\r\n\r\nWe will give examples and guidelines for creating your own affine types.

              "description": "When building software, we often need to associate metadata with the code we’re writing. A typical example is when we need to tell our linters to ignore a specific range of code. A common approach to adding this metadata is to embed it directly in the code using the syntax of the language, but this approach has a number of drawbacks including language specificity, potential for collision, and cluttering of the code.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we’ll look at an alternative approach that stores the metadata separate from the code using a technique called _anchoring_. The metadata is associated with an anchor, a region of code inside the source file. Critically, the anchor also includes a context, a snapshot of the code surrounding the anchored region. As the source code is changed, this context – along with some very interesting algorithms for aligning text -– is used to automatically update the anchors.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate these concepts we’ll look at spor, a tool that implements anchoring and anchor updating. The primary implementation of spor is in Python, so it’s very approachable and, indeed, open for contribution. As a side note, we’ll also look at a partial implementation of spor written in Rust. Finally, we’ll look at how spor is being used in Cosmic Ray, a mutation testing tool for Python.",

The IT department have been migrating all of their services onto kubernetes. This introduces a set of challenges to keep control without sacrificing agility or speed.\r\n\r\nThis talk will show how Hafslund Nett decided to use a Cloud Managed Kubernetes with RBAC and AD groups to get fine grained control, secure development projects, use namespaces to control worker nodes usage and how we ended on separated Kubernetes clusters for each cluster environment. Additionally OpenIDConnect is used to provide the customers facing applications with B2C capabilities.\r\n\r\nWe will show how the centralizing of logs enable us to do monitoring, display trends, optimizing resource usage, improve Kubernetes scheduling and feed the CI/CD pipelines to further improve the container services.",

The framework is quite simple and do not require understanding the underlying mechanisms for most day to day tasks. This workshop will take your skills up a level, giving you a thorough understanding of React.\r\n\r\nYou will create a working version of React in less than 200 lines of code. It won’t be as efficient as React is. Nonetheless, you will gain valuable insight into how React work under the hood. We will demystify a lot of the concepts that are taken for granted when using React: representing the DOM-tree, rendering components, setting state and props, and re-rendering.",

In this session, we will strip them to bare math, so next time you use a machine learning library, you'll have a deeper understanding of what lies underneath.\r\n\r\nDuring this session, we will first provide a short history of machine learning and an overview of two basic teaching techniques: supervised and unsupervised learning.\r\n\r\nWe will start by defining what machine learning is and equip you with an intuition of how it works. We will then explain gradient descent algorithm with the use of simple linear regression to give you an even deeper understanding of this learning method. Then we will project it to supervised neural networks training.\r\n\r\nWithin unsupervised learning, you will become familiar with Hebb’s learning and learning with concurrency (winner takes all and winner takes most algorithms). We will use Octave for examples in this session; however, you can use your favorite technology to implement presented ideas.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to show the mathematical basics of neural networks for those who want to start using machine learning in their day-to-day work or use it already but find it difficult to understand the underlying processes. After viewing our presentation, you should find it easier to select parameters for your networks and feel more confident in your selection of network type, as well as be encouraged to dive into more complex and powerful deep learning methods.\r\n\r\nLevel: beginner\r\n",

With a rapid evolution of services becoming available in each cloud provider, companies tend to focus and keep updated with only one of them while other providers capabilities are simply unknown, ignored or forgotten. \r\nOn the other hand, there are many companies that are not yet using public cloud and are now facing the dilemma of which Public Cloud provider to choose.\r\n\r\nAI and Machine Learning are key areas of investment, growth and differentiation for many companies and that is no exception for the three biggest public cloud players (AWS, GCP and Azure). In this context, pre-trained AI/ML API’s in combination with other Serverless services is one area that has been on the rise and with fast adoption. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we will learn about the three major public cloud providers (AWS, GCP and Azure) by having an overview and gain insights about each other pros and cons. In addition, we are going to explore their AI/ML Cloud API’s that allow us to leverage ready-made capabilities such as: Text to Speech, Image & Video Classification, Translation,  Speech Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, etc.\r\n\r\n",

This talk will focus on portable source instrumentation techniques such as logging, tracing and metrics. Straightforward, but well designed code additions can drastically ease the troubleshooting of functional issues, and identification of performance bottlenecks, in production.\r\n\r\nOf course when dealing with C++ performance is often critical, and so minimizing the cost of any instrumentation is also critical. Key to this is understanding the trade-off between the detail of information collected, and the overheads of exposing that information. It is also important to understand how best to benefit from advances in contemporary monitoring infrastructure, popularised by cloud environments.\r\n\r\nThis talk will open with some brief motivation towards monitoring and instrumentation. It will then walk through some practical code examples using some generic instrumentation primitives, based on proven principles employed in demanding production software. ",

Many companies are talking about it, while very few are actually doing it. At Inmeta, we have together with partners and clients implemented 40+ machine learning projects in the past few years. In this talk, I will share the top 5 lessons we learned from doing machine learning for real.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 2: test && commit || revert. What?! - Kari Eline Strandjord\r\n\r\n`test && commit || revert` is a workflow developed during a week of code camp at Iterate with Kent Beck. The main idea is that your code should always be in a valid state. If the test passes, the code is committed. If it fails, you lose all your changes, and the code is forced back to the last valid state. At first, the idea seemed both unrealistic and a bit harsh. But after trying it out during a longer period writing an application in Elm, it did change my way of coding. \r\n\r\nThe talk will give a brief explanation of the workflow. I will also share my experiences from using it in a real project.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 3: Five Ways to Break a Git Repository - Edward Thomson\r\n\r\nCan you break your Git repository? I hope not! That's where you keep all your stuff! Edward Thomson shows you five common mistakes that break Git repositories and how to fix them.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 4: Unlocking the doors of parliament - Sindre Lindstad\r\n\r\nWhen Norway's Minister of Children and Families was instated, he enthusiastically showed the world the key to his new office through press photos.\r\n\r\nThe only problem was that it was a plastic punch-hole keycard, which meant anyone could make a copy.\r\n\r\nSo I made one with 3D printing (and lasers!).

            "description": "Ever since we started breaking applications into services, be it in the era of SOA or more recently with microservices, we’ve struggled to incorporate user interfaces into our decoupled, distributed architectures. We’ve seen frontends versioned separately with tight coupling to our services, breaking cohesion. We’ve seen the rise of Backend-For-Frontend and the emerge of micro frontends. We talk about composition, yet so many projects fail to implement actual composition. Instead we end up with some kind of compromise, with repeated business logic in the front-end, back-end and API, making it hard to scale – especially when multiple teams are involved – causing lock-step deployment, latency, bottlenecks and coordination issues.\r\n\r\nWhat if we could find a viable solution that allowed us to scale development, keep distribution and cohesion and also provide composition of user interfaces?\r\n\r\nIn this talk you are introduced to the evolution of compositional user interfaces and existing patterns while we discover their pros and cons, before diving into the architecture and development of compositional interfaces using hypermedia and micro-frontends. We go beyond the simple “Hello World” example that always seems to work, and you’ll learn patterns in modelling and design that will get you up and running with decoupled, composed user interfaces in your day job.\r\n",

By embracing the React-like MVU architecture, you can do away with your Xaml, your behaviours, your converters, your templating, your MVVM and embrace the simplicity of functional model descriptions and view re-evalaution. I will talk about the concepts involved and how this differs from Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), the tooling available and how yuo can get involved.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly a conceptual talk and won’t be full of sparkling demos: demo apps are available from the Fabulous community.\r\n\r\nNote, Fabulous is a community project and is at version 0.34 as of May 2019. It is not a supported product or framework from Microsoft.\r\n\r\nhttps://fsprojects.github.io/Fabulous/",

Using Azure B2C allows you to offload authentication to other identity providers while keeping authorization tasks local to your system.\r\n\r\nOffload the hassles of lost passwords, expiring accounts and more, leaving you time to build and maintain the things that are important to your system.\r\n\r\nAndrew will demonstrate the setup and configuration of this powerful identity federation system allowing integration of any combination of social identities such as Facebook or twitter, as well as organisational accounts like Active Directory and others. He'll also discuss the extension points allowing complete control of the identity system including rules-based identity flows and calling out to custom REST services as part of the claims processing flow,\r\n\r\nIf your system needs to include users from outside your organisation, this is a must-see session.\r\n",

            "description": "Just about everyone is doing microservices these days, at least that's what they're claiming. Microservices is the new black! But, how well are they really doing? When breaking things up there is a risk of ending up in the same rut as SOA did a decade ago, in effect creating distributed monoliths. So, is it at all possible for anyone to reach the promised land consisting of autonomous, cohesive, and loosely coupled services? \r\n\r\nMy claim is that it is doable, but not without some up-front modelling under the guidance of Domain-driven Design concepts like \"bounded context\", \"core domain\", \"ubiquitous language\" and “aggregates”. Distilling the domain, drilling deep into the core business concepts, and breaking it up into isolated and protected contexts will take you a long way. Add some business capability modelling and service-orientation into the mix, and you are halfway there. Use it as a map to guide you on the journey towards an orderly and robust distributed system, built by adding one MVP at the time in a low-risk agile manner. \r\n\r\nThis talk requires no previous experience with DDD, but it is advantageous if you are familiar with the challenges it attempts to solve, such as modularisation of unruly monoliths or managing a flock of microservices that make herding cats seem simple.",

Let me tell you more… \r\n\r\nAlmost all applications now depend on connectivity, but what do you do when the infrastructure is unreliable or the remote system is down or returns an error? Does your application grind to a halt or just drop that single request? What if you could recover from these kinds of error, maybe even so quickly it won’t be noticed? \r\n \r\nWith Polly your application can easily tolerate transient faults and longer outages in remote systems or infrastructure.  \r\n\r\nAt the end of this hour you will know how to use all the features of Polly to make your application a rock solid piece of work. \r\n\r\nWe’ll start with the simple but very powerful Retry Policy which lets you retry a failed request. If simple retries are not good enough for you, there is a Wait and Retry policy which introduces a delay between retries, giving the remote service time to recover before being hit again. Then I show you how to use the circuit breaker for when things have really gone wrong and a remote system is struggling under too much load or has failed. If all these attempts are unsuccessful and you are still not getting through to the remote system, you can return a default response or execute arbitrary code to call for human help (or restart the cloud) with the fallback policy. \r\n\r\nThat takes care of what you can do when things go wrong, but Polly also lets you take proactive steps to keep your application and the services it depends on healthy.  \r\n\r\nTo get you started with proactive strategies, you will learn how caching can be used to store and return responses from an in-memory or distributed cache without having to hit the remote server every time. Or you can use bulkhead isolation to marshal resources within your application so that no one struggling part can take down the whole. Finally, I’ll show you how to fail quickly when your application is in danger of being overloaded or the remote systems is not responding in a timely fashion, this is done with the bulkhead isolation and the timeout polices.   \r\n\r\nOh, and did I mention Polly is a .NET Standard library so it will work on any application you can think of! Join me for an hour, and your applications will never be the same. ",

Data scientists don't tend to focus on testing and deploying models to production systems in sync with software releases. Working with software engineers and IT operations in a repeatable, automated, coherent pipeline is still an afterthought in many organisations, and data science teams are left out of the loop.\r\n\r\nLet's look at an end-to-end software and data science delivery pipeline that is repeatable and robust.

Fast-forward to now: my phone is about a million times more powerful than that Tandon; screens are 3840x2160 pixels; every computer in the world is attached to every other thing with no cables; and we code using... still basically C.\r\n\r\nHaving lived through all these changes in realtime, and as an incurable neophile, I think I can make an educated guess as to what the next 30 years are going to be like, and what we're all going to be doing by 2049.

What can we do to tame these monsters into submission so that they will produce our wonderful designs? We will introduce you to the most common monsters in the workplace and give you some of our tools to handle them.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 2: I Love Learning From People! - Bryan Hogan\r\n\r\nI've been podcasting for almost five years and I love making every single episode. I talk to people from around the world about what they love doing, and share this with everyone. \r\n\r\nMost people you meet love to talk about topics that interest them and with the right questions they will tell you everything they know.\r\n\r\nIn just ten short minutes I'm going to share some of what I've learned about how you can learn from others - how to ask questions, how to listen, how to encourage, when to disagree, when to interrupt and when to stay quiet.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 3: \"OMG! A Girl?!\" What to do when a woman joins your team - Meg Gotshall\r\n\r\nDon’t panic! Often when I join a team, my new colleagues second guess each and every behavior. Inevitably, this leads to some awkward situations (and in the wake of #MeToo, even fear)!\r\n\r\nAlthough women still make up a rather small percentage of the tech workforce, we’re not as uncommon as narwhals or unicorns, so I’d like to take a few minutes to talk candidly about how we can make this transition smoother and simpler for both sides. Applying a programmer’s pragmatism to social interactions, we can debug our working environment and hopefully make it run more smoothly.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 4: How to deal with your demons - Lubaba Farin Tanisha\r\n\r\nShould you care to know more about your biases? Does it even remotely related to software development? Is being aware of them make you a better software engineer? The answers to all these questions are: Oh yes! No matter what methodology or process you follow, it is possible to fall through the cracks for numerous amount of facts that you could have avoided if you knew about them before. If you knew that you are actually carrying many of them. So join my talk, I will walk you through a path that would perhaps make you discover a new you, with a brand new mindset to deal with your tasks, and of course to deal with your demons.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 5: Emojis – the fun and weird parts! - Jøran Vagnby Lillesand\r\n\r\nCome get a time out from useful learning and get a brief introduction to the surprisingly interesting world of emojis!\r\n\r\nEmojis – to most of us they're just a weird distraction from proper language. But they're actually a rather cool piece of technology (!) with a meaningful impact on society. I'll teach you 3 things you didn't know about emojis, but you'll be glad you do!\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------",

We will show you how to apply DevOps practices to cloud-based container solutions, complete with hands-on exercises. The training uses Microsoft tooling and technology, but the skills you will learn can be applied in any technology stack. After the workshop you will be able to do Docker DevOps style.\r\n\r\nAgenda:\r\nBig picture: DevOps with cloud-based container clusters \r\nAccelerating your inner development loop\r\nFrom development to production in record-time with confidence \r\nMonitoring and feedback while running in production \r\nAutomated provisioning of infrastructure \r\n\r\nObjectives:\r\nUnderstand the implications for DevOps teams to build, deploy and run container based solutions in a cloud environment.\r\nAutomate everything from infrastructure to deployment\r\nAchieve full traceability from source code to production incidents \r\nPractice finding and fixing a bug without downtime \r\nGet hands-on experience supporting DevOps practices with available tools\r\nTarget audience\r\n\r\nAudience:\r\nThis training is intended for developers and architects that want to learn about the new DevOps practices and tooling for a cloud-based Microsoft solution.\r\n\r\nGet a running start with the labs! \r\nThis workshop is specific towards Windows as the operating system for your machine. (The labs can also be done on Linux, although this can be a bit more challenging.)\r\n\r\nYou will need to have a development IDE installed. The preferred IDE is Visual Studio 2017.

Most of us think of them as materialised risks, but they also can be considered as opportunity. Opportunity to learn and improve. Would you be interested to learn how to draw conclusions from failures, propose corrective and preventive actions, and with them improve your development process and grow quality mindset in your team? This is a workshop for you.\r\n\r\nWe are all agile nowadays, thus we all strive to self improve iteration over iteration. Regular retrospectives help flush out issues with delivery process, compare current iteration with previous, identify things need addressing, areas worth investing in to increase velocity.\r\n\r\nHowever, what happens when we catch a bug? Do we sit together as a team to identify what went wrong as we would normally do seeing a drop in our velocity in current sprint? I don’t think so. Most likely team will fix the bug and move on with feature development. Probably new regression tests will be added to prevent the bug from happening in future.\r\n\r\nRegression doesn’t prevent bugs from happening. It helps with catching recurring symptoms of deeper problems, before they reach our customer and our users. Tests alone don’t address root causes. We’re like doctors prescribing yet another drugs. Not spending enough time on doing patient interview to find problems with lifestyle. Missing nutrients in our team diet.\r\n\r\nYou will learn how to spot and prevent sources of bugs.

Components are a staple of front-end development as they increase development speed, consistency, and reduce the need for repeat code. To create components often we turn to frameworks such as Angular, React, and Vue but we don't need to. \r\n\r\nUsing nothing more than HTML and Javascript that is readily available to us in all modern browsers we can create components that work without being tied to any one front-end framework. \r\n\r\nYou will walk away with the knowledge you need to go forth and create your own components, understand how to make them look gorgeous, and what if any limitations there are.

In this session, we will strip them to bare math, so next time you use a machine learning library, you'll have a deeper understanding of what lies underneath.\r\n\r\nDuring this session, we will first provide a short history of machine learning and an overview of two basic teaching techniques: supervised and unsupervised learning.\r\n\r\nWe will start by defining what machine learning is and equip you with an intuition of how it works. We will then explain gradient descent algorithm with the use of simple linear regression to give you an even deeper understanding of this learning method. Then we will project it to supervised neural networks training.\r\n\r\nWithin unsupervised learning, you will become familiar with Hebb’s learning and learning with concurrency (winner takes all and winner takes most algorithms). We will use Octave for examples in this session; however, you can use your favorite technology to implement presented ideas.\r\n\r\nOur aim is to show the mathematical basics of neural networks for those who want to start using machine learning in their day-to-day work or use it already but find it difficult to understand the underlying processes. After viewing our presentation, you should find it easier to select parameters for your networks and feel more confident in your selection of network type, as well as be encouraged to dive into more complex and powerful deep learning methods.\r\n\r\nLevel: beginner\r\n",

              "description": "Ever since we started breaking applications into services, be it in the era of SOA or more recently with microservices, we’ve struggled to incorporate user interfaces into our decoupled, distributed architectures. We’ve seen frontends versioned separately with tight coupling to our services, breaking cohesion. We’ve seen the rise of Backend-For-Frontend and the emerge of micro frontends. We talk about composition, yet so many projects fail to implement actual composition. Instead we end up with some kind of compromise, with repeated business logic in the front-end, back-end and API, making it hard to scale – especially when multiple teams are involved – causing lock-step deployment, latency, bottlenecks and coordination issues.\r\n\r\nWhat if we could find a viable solution that allowed us to scale development, keep distribution and cohesion and also provide composition of user interfaces?\r\n\r\nIn this talk you are introduced to the evolution of compositional user interfaces and existing patterns while we discover their pros and cons, before diving into the architecture and development of compositional interfaces using hypermedia and micro-frontends. We go beyond the simple “Hello World” example that always seems to work, and you’ll learn patterns in modelling and design that will get you up and running with decoupled, composed user interfaces in your day job.\r\n",

The open question remains, when to use a particular test and how it impacts the ultimate decision whether a particular product requires additional investments.\r\n\r\nThis presentation uses a real-world red team attack against a multi-layer product as an example for discussing the differences of security tests. It shows, how the attacker starts with user-facing XML-RPC interface, breaks through multiple defense layers and ends up with root access to the database server and target data exfiltration. The example points out:\r\n- different areas where the tests improve the knowledge about the security risks of the product,\r\n- what are the requirements to obtain actionable results and\r\n- who needs to be involved to actually benefit from the results reported.\r\nThe presentation encourages expanding the security tests beyond the product features towards the security of the environment where it is deployed, supporting processes, as well as a product developers and administrators. It also shows, how the closer collaboration between different teams improves the overall security of the product",

              "description": "It is essential to discuss how modern C++ code can be effectively instrumented, in order to effectively monitor it after deployment. This talk will focus on portable source instrumentation techniques such as logging, tracing and metrics. Straightforward, but well designed code additions can drastically ease the troubleshooting of functional issues, and identification of performance bottlenecks, in production.\r\n\r\nOf course when dealing with C++ performance is often critical, and so minimizing the cost of any instrumentation is also critical. Key to this is understanding the trade-off between the detail of information collected, and the overheads of exposing that information. It is also important to understand how best to benefit from advances in contemporary monitoring infrastructure, popularised by cloud environments.\r\n\r\nThis talk will open with some brief motivation towards monitoring and instrumentation. It will then walk through some practical code examples using some generic instrumentation primitives, based on proven principles employed in demanding production software. ",

Encapsulating your database server in a container and your database in a storage container can dramatically lighten the load and make your database as agile as your model and other processes. And you can even use a serious enterprise class database like SQL Server this way. This session will show how to benefit from using a containerized version of SQL Server for Linux during development and testing. We'll also address concerns about data that needs to be persisted. You'll also get a peek at the DevOps side of this, including using images in your CI/CD process.",

We’ve read books about domain-driven design and event sourcing, we’ve been to conferences and learned about micro services and REST APIs. Some of us remember working with n-tiers and stored procedures… some of us are still using them. But the role of a systems architect is still one of the most misunderstood things about the software development process. What does the architect actually do? If you’re working with a systems architect, what can you expect from them? And if you are a systems architect, what are your team expecting from you?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Dylan will share his own insights into the idea of architecture as part of a software development process. We’ll explore some popular architectural patterns and processes - and a couple of obscure ones as well - and look at how, and when, you can incorporate those patterns into your own projects. We’ll talk about how the idea of software architecture has changed over time, and  share some tips and advice for developers who find themselves working with architecture as part of their role.",

Let me tell you more… \r\n\r\nAlmost all applications now depend on connectivity, but what do you do when the infrastructure is unreliable or the remote system is down or returns an error? Does your application grind to a halt or just drop that single request? What if you could recover from these kinds of error, maybe even so quickly it won’t be noticed? \r\n \r\nWith Polly your application can easily tolerate transient faults and longer outages in remote systems or infrastructure.  \r\n\r\nAt the end of this hour you will know how to use all the features of Polly to make your application a rock solid piece of work. \r\n\r\nWe’ll start with the simple but very powerful Retry Policy which lets you retry a failed request. If simple retries are not good enough for you, there is a Wait and Retry policy which introduces a delay between retries, giving the remote service time to recover before being hit again. Then I show you how to use the circuit breaker for when things have really gone wrong and a remote system is struggling under too much load or has failed. If all these attempts are unsuccessful and you are still not getting through to the remote system, you can return a default response or execute arbitrary code to call for human help (or restart the cloud) with the fallback policy. \r\n\r\nThat takes care of what you can do when things go wrong, but Polly also lets you take proactive steps to keep your application and the services it depends on healthy.  \r\n\r\nTo get you started with proactive strategies, you will learn how caching can be used to store and return responses from an in-memory or distributed cache without having to hit the remote server every time. Or you can use bulkhead isolation to marshal resources within your application so that no one struggling part can take down the whole. Finally, I’ll show you how to fail quickly when your application is in danger of being overloaded or the remote systems is not responding in a timely fashion, this is done with the bulkhead isolation and the timeout polices.   \r\n\r\nOh, and did I mention Polly is a .NET Standard library so it will work on any application you can think of! Join me for an hour, and your applications will never be the same. ",

Many companies are talking about it, while very few are actually doing it. At Inmeta, we have together with partners and clients implemented 40+ machine learning projects in the past few years. In this talk, I will share the top 5 lessons we learned from doing machine learning for real.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 2: test && commit || revert. What?! - Kari Eline Strandjord\r\n\r\n`test && commit || revert` is a workflow developed during a week of code camp at Iterate with Kent Beck. The main idea is that your code should always be in a valid state. If the test passes, the code is committed. If it fails, you lose all your changes, and the code is forced back to the last valid state. At first, the idea seemed both unrealistic and a bit harsh. But after trying it out during a longer period writing an application in Elm, it did change my way of coding. \r\n\r\nThe talk will give a brief explanation of the workflow. I will also share my experiences from using it in a real project.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 3: Five Ways to Break a Git Repository - Edward Thomson\r\n\r\nCan you break your Git repository? I hope not! That's where you keep all your stuff! Edward Thomson shows you five common mistakes that break Git repositories and how to fix them.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 4: Unlocking the doors of parliament - Sindre Lindstad\r\n\r\nWhen Norway's Minister of Children and Families was instated, he enthusiastically showed the world the key to his new office through press photos.\r\n\r\nThe only problem was that it was a plastic punch-hole keycard, which meant anyone could make a copy.\r\n\r\nSo I made one with 3D printing (and lasers!). But does it work?\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------- ",

              "description": "Just about everyone is doing microservices these days, at least that's what they're claiming. Microservices is the new black! But, how well are they really doing? When breaking things up there is a risk of ending up in the same rut as SOA did a decade ago, in effect creating distributed monoliths. So, is it at all possible for anyone to reach the promised land consisting of autonomous, cohesive, and loosely coupled services? \r\n\r\nMy claim is that it is doable, but not without some up-front modelling under the guidance of Domain-driven Design concepts like \"bounded context\", \"core domain\", \"ubiquitous language\" and “aggregates”. Distilling the domain, drilling deep into the core business concepts, and breaking it up into isolated and protected contexts will take you a long way. Add some business capability modelling and service-orientation into the mix, and you are halfway there. Use it as a map to guide you on the journey towards an orderly and robust distributed system, built by adding one MVP at the time in a low-risk agile manner. \r\n\r\nThis talk requires no previous experience with DDD, but it is advantageous if you are familiar with the challenges it attempts to solve, such as modularisation of unruly monoliths or managing a flock of microservices that make herding cats seem simple.",

It also allows us to find the detection patterns if it is attempted to be exploited on our infrastructure. And besides all of it – it is fun to hack the servers! It also shows that we can do much better than just blindly upgrading components. There are examples of vulnerabilities, which are fixed not with a single patch, but rather through a series of upgrades leading to more secure solutions, so it is important to stop for a while and think about other attack paths and consequences, that can be faced.

Most of us think of them as materialised risks, but they also can be considered as opportunity. Opportunity to learn and improve. Would you be interested to learn how to draw conclusions from failures, propose corrective and preventive actions, and with them improve your development process and grow quality mindset in your team? This is a workshop for you.\r\n\r\nWe are all agile nowadays, thus we all strive to self improve iteration over iteration. Regular retrospectives help flush out issues with delivery process, compare current iteration with previous, identify things need addressing, areas worth investing in to increase velocity.\r\n\r\nHowever, what happens when we catch a bug? Do we sit together as a team to identify what went wrong as we would normally do seeing a drop in our velocity in current sprint? I don’t think so. Most likely team will fix the bug and move on with feature development. Probably new regression tests will be added to prevent the bug from happening in future.\r\n\r\nRegression doesn’t prevent bugs from happening. It helps with catching recurring symptoms of deeper problems, before they reach our customer and our users. Tests alone don’t address root causes. We’re like doctors prescribing yet another drugs. Not spending enough time on doing patient interview to find problems with lifestyle. Missing nutrients in our team diet.\r\n\r\nYou will learn how to spot and prevent sources of bugs. We’ll walk you through Root Cause Analysis process on a real life incident you can relate to. Help you understand all vital parts of such analysis, and show you how you can conduct similar process next time you catch a bug.\r\n\r\nDuring workshop you will learn:\r\n-techniques helping build context in which incident happened,\r\n-how to build timeline and why it’s important to have one,\r\n-how to identify causal factors and how they differ from root cause,\r\n-techniques helping figure out root cause,\r\n-what are preventive and corrective actions,\r\n-how root cause analysis can not only help prevent bugs from recurring but improve your testing skills.\r\n \r\nKey takeaways:\r\n- what is root cause analysis\r\n- what are causal factors and how they are different from root causes\r\n- techniques helping identify root cause, propose preventive and corrective actions\r\n- how being better in identifying root causes can help you become better tester by focusing your attention on most likely broken parts of your system\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipant requirements: Nothing.

Components are a staple of front-end development as they increase development speed, consistency, and reduce the need for repeat code. To create components often we turn to frameworks such as Angular, React, and Vue but we don't need to. \r\n\r\nUsing nothing more than HTML and Javascript that is readily available to us in all modern browsers we can create components that work without being tied to any one front-end framework. \r\n\r\nYou will walk away with the knowledge you need to go forth and create your own components, understand how to make them look gorgeous, and what if any limitations there are. Also, find out how you can bring back the blink tag!\r\n",

With a rapid evolution of services becoming available in each cloud provider, companies tend to focus and keep updated with only one of them while other providers capabilities are simply unknown, ignored or forgotten. \r\nOn the other hand, there are many companies that are not yet using public cloud and are now facing the dilemma of which Public Cloud provider to choose.\r\n\r\nAI and Machine Learning are key areas of investment, growth and differentiation for many companies and that is no exception for the three biggest public cloud players (AWS, GCP and Azure). In this context, pre-trained AI/ML API’s in combination with other Serverless services is one area that has been on the rise and with fast adoption. \r\n\r\nIn this talk we will learn about the three major public cloud providers (AWS, GCP and Azure) by having an overview and gain insights about each other pros and cons. In addition, we are going to explore their AI/ML Cloud API’s that allow us to leverage ready-made capabilities such as: Text to Speech, Image & Video Classification, Translation,  Speech Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, etc.\r\n\r\n",

In this talk, I’ll take the audience through all aspects of our Agile transformation: overcoming resistance to change within the team and the department, why we struggled with our initial choice of the Scrum framework, why we wanted to try Kanban, how we moved to Scrumban and most importantly, what we’re going to do next since true Agile transformations never really end.\r\n\r\nYou’ll walk away with some ideas to overcome change fatigue and resistance that can work for both small teams and large organizations, an understanding of how Scrum and Kanban both helped us become a better DevOps team, and why the move to Scrumban was the right choice for our team at that time and might be right for you.

Software engineering has been maturing for decades, but introducing an unfamiliar parallel workstream like data science brings new challenges. Thankfully, we can draw upon the cross-team collaborative efforts of DevOps to bring data science and software engineering into sync.\r\n\r\nBuilding effective predictive models involves data acquisition and preparation, then resource-intensive experimentation and training. Data scientists don't tend to focus on testing and deploying models to production systems in sync with software releases. Working with software engineers and IT operations in a repeatable, automated, coherent pipeline is still an afterthought in many organisations, and data science teams are left out of the loop.\r\n\r\nLet's look at an end-to-end software and data science delivery pipeline that is repeatable and robust. We'll focus on model source control, repeatable data preparation, model training and continuous retraining, code validation and testing, model storage and versioning, and production deployment. Data scientists and software engineers can work together effectively to produce smart software. Let's learn how!",

Inevitably, this leads to some awkward situations (and in the wake of #MeToo, even fear)!\r\n\r\nAlthough women still make up a rather small percentage of the tech workforce, we’re not as uncommon as narwhals or unicorns, so I’d like to take a few minutes to talk candidly about how we can make this transition smoother and simpler for both sides. Applying a programmer’s pragmatism to social interactions, we can debug our working environment and hopefully make it run more smoothly.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 4: How to deal with your demons - Lubaba Farin Tanisha\r\n\r\nShould you care to know more about your biases? Does it even remotely related to software development? Is being aware of them make you a better software engineer? The answers to all these questions are: Oh yes! No matter what methodology or process you follow, it is possible to fall through the cracks for numerous amount of facts that you could have avoided if you knew about them before. If you knew that you are actually carrying many of them. So join my talk, I will walk you through a path that would perhaps make you discover a new you, with a brand new mindset to deal with your tasks, and of course to deal with your demons.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTalk 5: Emojis – the fun and weird parts! - Jøran Vagnby Lillesand\r\n\r\nCome get a time out from useful learning and get a brief introduction to the surprisingly interesting world of emojis!\r\n\r\nEmojis – to most of us they're just a weird distraction from proper language. But they're actually a rather cool piece of technology (!) with a meaningful impact on society. I'll teach you 3 things you didn't know about emojis, but you'll be glad you do!\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------",

              "description": "Do you have this feeling certain features will yet again start failing in upcoming release? When you catch a bug, does it seem like a deja vu? Incidents happen. Most of us think of them as materialised risks, but they also can be considered as opportunity. Opportunity to learn and improve. Would you be interested to learn how to draw conclusions from failures, propose corrective and preventive actions, and with them improve your development process and grow quality mindset in your team? This is a workshop for you.\r\n\r\nWe are all agile nowadays, thus we all strive to self improve iteration over iteration. Regular retrospectives help flush out issues with delivery process, compare current iteration with previous, identify things need addressing, areas worth investing in to increase velocity.\r\n\r\nHowever, what happens when we catch a bug? Do we sit together as a team to identify what went wrong as we would normally do seeing a drop in our velocity in current sprint? I don’t think so. Most likely team will fix the bug and move on with feature development. Probably new regression tests will be added to prevent the bug from happening in future.\r\n\r\nRegression doesn’t prevent bugs from happening. It helps with catching recurring symptoms of deeper problems, before they reach our customer and our users. Tests alone don’t address root causes. We’re like doctors prescribing yet another drugs. Not spending enough time on doing patient interview to find problems with lifestyle. Missing nutrients in our team diet.\r\n\r\nYou will learn how to spot and prevent sources of bugs. We’ll walk you through Root Cause Analysis process on a real life incident you can relate to. Help you understand all vital parts of such analysis, and show you how you can conduct similar process next time you catch a bug.\r\n\r\nDuring workshop you will learn:\r\n-techniques helping build context in which incident happened,\r\n-how to build timeline and why it’s important to have one,\r\n-how to identify causal factors and how they differ from root cause,\r\n-techniques helping figure out root cause,\r\n-what are preventive and corrective actions,\r\n-how root cause analysis can not only help prevent bugs from recurring but improve your testing skills.\r\n\r\nKey takeaways:\r\n- what is root cause analysis\r\n- what are causal factors and how they are different from root causes\r\n- techniques helping identify root cause, propose preventive and corrective actions\r\n- how being better in identifying root causes can help you become better tester by focusing your attention on most likely broken parts of your system\r\n\r\nParticipant requirements: Nothing. This is an offline workshop.",

Making sure you know who they are and what they can do is pretty important too.\r\n\r\nIn this session Microsoft Engineer Andrew Coates will present techniques for allowing users to log into your system with credentials from another system. Using Azure B2C allows you to offload authentication to other identity providers while keeping authorization tasks local to your system.\r\n\r\nOffload the hassles of lost passwords, expiring accounts and more, leaving you time to build and maintain the things that are important to your system.\r\n\r\nAndrew will demonstrate the setup and configuration of this powerful identity federation system allowing integration of any combination of social identities such as Facebook or twitter, as well as organisational accounts like Active Directory and others. He'll also discuss the extension points allowing complete control of the identity system including rules-based identity flows and calling out to custom REST services as part of the claims processing flow,\r\n\r\nIf your system needs to include users from outside your organisation, this is a must-see session.\r\n",
